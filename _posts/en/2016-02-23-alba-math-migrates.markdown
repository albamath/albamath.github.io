Cool, my [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) generated website is on-line at [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)!

You can see my previous attempts to have a personal blog/website here (frome the most recent to the less recent):

 * sketch of a blog at wordpress : [albamath.wordpress.com][wordpress];
 * a neat tumblr : [albamath.tumblr.com][tumblr];
 * plain html at my website in Orsay : [www.math.u-psud.fr/~malaga][upsud].

The idea is that (almost) all this content will finish up gathered at [albamath.com](http://albamath.com). I hope that this will not take me too much time because instructions exist for both migrating [from Tumblr to Jekyll](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/tumblr/) and [from Wordpress.com to Jekyll](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpressdotcom/).

P.S. Unfortunately, the blog that I had at the adress albankillapi.blogspot.com disappeared forever (and somebody took the adress, without filling it with content).
