For the moment, [alba~math](http://albamath.com) stays on Wordpress.
The two main reasons are:

  *  I lack time and wordpress is easier thus less time-consuming to maintain;
  *  I am teaching Wordpress development and I need a site to test it on.

I like a lot the ideas behind Jekyll, that's why I will keep this repository active for maybe coming back later to it.
